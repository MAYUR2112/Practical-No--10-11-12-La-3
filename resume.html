<article> 1.Covid-19 </article>
<p></p>
<p> The pandemic has altered people’s lives in both enormous and small ways. Our editors have picked the top recent blogs that dig into the details of what COVID-19 means for people: the impact on women and the young, what it means for the food supply, and how it can increase already growing inequality, to name a few.</p>
<p></p>
<p>COVID-19 is a stark reminder of longstanding inequities in our societies, and how policies need to pay specific attention to protect and lift the least advantaged in society. 
</p>
<p></p>
<article> 2.Low Internet Access Driving Inequality </article>
<p> COVID-19 and the Great Lockdown triggered a mass migration from analog to digital and highlighted that access to the Internet is crucial for socioeconomic inclusion.</p>
<p></p>
<p> High-speed Internet is key for working from home, for children’s education when they can’t attend school in person, for telemedicine, for benefiting from social support programs, and for enabling access to financial services for everyone, especially for those living in remote areas.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Still, Internet usage remains a luxury: half of the world’s population does not have access to the Internet, either through a mobile device or through fixed line broadband.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Advanced economies like the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada have the highest access rates. Big emerging economies show large disparities in the proportion of Internet users in their populations, which range from about two-thirds in Brazil and Mexico to about one-third in India.</p>
<p></p>
<p> So, how can policymakers support affordable and universal access to the Internet?</p>
<p></p>
<p> Governments can foster a digital-friendly business and regulatory environment for the private sector. This can be instrumental to accelerate and finance investments in infrastructure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Government support, for instance by ensuring the Internet investment is complemented with universal electricity access, is essential. In addition, subsidies may be needed so that all households—including disadvantaged groups and those in rural and remote areas—have access to quality Internet, and to ensure there is no digital gender gap. For example, in response to the COVID-19 crisis, the governments of El Salvador, Malaysia and Nepal have introduced Internet fee discounts or waivers.</p>
